# Advent Of Code 2025

This repo contains my solutions for the 2025 edition of the Advent Of Code challenge. This year I decided to challenge myself by writing all my solutions in Swift - a language that I don't have a lot of prior experience with. The main motivation for this was to learn the Swift tooling and package system, so that I could use these more confidently in future projects.

This is all just for fun, so I haven't committed to actually completing all of the puzzles.
